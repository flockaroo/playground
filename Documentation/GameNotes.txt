h1. Game Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Low-tec space battles
** WW2/"Wing Commander Movie" style...
** Dumb torpedos for attacking capital ships (aim before release)
*** Think about torpedo tubes that can be rotated
*** Salvos with slightly different direction like WW2 subs ("FÃ¤cher")
** WW2 style AA-gun fire with timed exploding shells
** Small weapons fire not hull-breaching
*** Pulse lasers and small homing missiles...
*** Can be used to damage capitol ship thrusters/sensors/power supply
** Large static laser only on capital ships (aim before shoot)
*** Long recharge times for balance
** Capitol ships should break/fracture where hit by torpedo/finishing projectile
*** Parts may still function if have CPU/fire-control, weapons and energy
*** Ship's internal spaces should be modelled roughly (all slots reachable)
** Torpedo impact/explosion influences ships impulse/speed/acceleration

* Visual style/look and feel
** Comic-style similar to clone wars but less realistic (e.g. no dirt textures)
** Low-poly (fracturing/breaking!) with some mechanical details
*** Opening/closing slot/silo doors
*** Visible thrust vectoring
*** Consistent scale for geometric details
** Smoothing/latency on thrust for visualization
** User interface
*** Avoid classical 2D style
*** Use 3D/hologram + interactive labels
** Think about using geometry only and no textures
*** Faction color and logo texture layers?
** Horizontal blur for engine/thruster highlights

* Units and customization
** Hardpoint-based modular approach
*** Slots (small: torpedo tube, med: mining/maintenance bots, large: fighters/static lasers)
*** Internal/external hardpoints (small, med, large)
*** Internal hardpoints: Power generators/storage, fire-control, auto-pilot, ...
*** External hardpoints: Sensors, guns, torpedo tubes, shield generators, ...
*** Thrust-less launch of fighters from large slots on rotating ship segment
*** Think about unifying slots and hardpoints (combine into two sizes only?)
** Unit sizes
*** Small (mining/maintenance bots)
*** Medium (fighters)
*** Large (small carriers, small mining ships, small transport ships)
*** Capital (battle ships w/w/o carrier caps, mining ships)
** Fire-control and auto-pilot CPUs with SW feature sets
*** E.g. fire-control CPU that can control three guns on external HPs
** Model on-board energy consumption/generation/storage?
** Model fuel/propulsion for bots and all other ships
** All units/components modeled and simulated properly
** State-machine based definition of control logic

* Sensors
** Direction-dependant/cross-section based signature simulation
*** For varios sensors (radar, infrared...)
** "Schleichfahrt"-like ping sensors (WW2 subs again...)
** Simulate noise and inaccuracies
** Realistically modeled CV sensors?

* Asteroids/planets
** All procedurally generated
** Minify planetary scale to keep gameplay alive

* Mining mechanics
** Surveying satellites gather map of mineral deposits
*** Survey result maps can be sold (device that generates fake maps?)
** Mining drones go back and forth between deposits and mining ship

* Story
** Factions: Earth force, colonies, pirates/raiders, aliens?

* Miscellaneous ideas
** Robotic war simplification
*** No cockpits and characters
*** Just cameras and HUDs
** Multi-crew/large ships
*** Moving around in the ship takes time
** Descent 6DOF gameplay aspect
*** Large asteroids with caves
